# VggT

Satellite-guided and BEV-guided 3D reconstruction research scaffold.

This project uses G3T as the main gravity-aligned reconstruction reference and uses the Look from Above paper as the main nuScenes satellite/BEV alignment paradigm reference.

See `agent.md` for the research纲领 and working rules.

`refs/g3t` is a cloned reference repository. `refs/look-from-above` stores notes for the Look from Above paradigm, which currently has no codebase. `refs/look-from-above-components` contains public component references such as PseudoMapTrainer and MapTR; these are the accepted engineering references for implementing the paper's ideas.
